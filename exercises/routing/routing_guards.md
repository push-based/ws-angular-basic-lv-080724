# Exercise: Router Guards

> !!! TBD !!!

Please implement a validation for the params. If the category is something else
than `popular | upcoming | top_rated` navigate the user to the `NotFoundPage` or some other valid url.

In the most clean way you implement it as a `CanActivateGuard`.

`ng g guard ....`

Please study the return values of the `canActivate` method and think about different solutions
to navigate the user to a correct url :-)
